						<h2> ABOUT THIS GAME </h2>
						<hr>
						<p> Masters of Percussion is a game with the main <strong>purpose of 
							teaching players about the different percussion instruments 
							that exist in the different regions and cultures of the world, 
							their level of complexity and their moves.</strong> The game will star 
							a small bear, controlled by the player, who will be able to 
							converse with various animal NPCs about the instruments of his 
							culture and will have to pass levels of obstacles that separate 
							each region or culture. In addition, to test the player's learning, 
							he will perform a series of quizzes in order to advance in the game 
							and continue his journey.</p>

						<hr>
						<p> 
							Playing is really easy. All you have to do is push the button on 
							the top right corner, register and start having fun learning about 
							percussion instruments. As for the mechanics, remember that to progress 
							you have to answer a ultimate quiz with the information given by 
							different characters. Move around the world with “WASD” keys. To 
							start each interaction use “F” on your keyboard and space to move on. 
							Inside the exams use the arrows, mouse and enter to select the answers, 
							but be QUICK! Answering will grant you passage to path towards other worlds. 
							However you have to overcome the obstacles and enemies on the way with the 
							instruments you may have earned.
